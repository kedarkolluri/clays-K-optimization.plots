This repo contains basic Julia script for generating plots for Clays paper.
The data is generated by optimization (see scripts) followed by some post processing (see cpp repo)

Install Julia from [julialang][julialang.org]

Plots are really made using matplotlib called from Julia. One can create these plots directly using Python as well
